# Legal Contradiction Detection Pipeline - Project Summary

## üèÜ What We Built

A complete end-to-end pipeline for detecting contradictions in legal documents using OpenAI's advanced AI models (o3-mini with gpt-4o fallback).

## üéØ Key Achievements

### 1. Complete Pipeline Architecture
- **Legal Contract Generator**: Creates realistic synthetic contracts with and without contradictions
- **Contradiction Detector**: Uses advanced AI prompting to identify contradictions
- **Performance Evaluator**: Calculates comprehensive metrics and generates reports
- **Interactive Runner**: User-friendly interface for running the pipeline

### 2. Advanced AI Integration
- **Primary Model**: OpenAI o3-mini for superior reasoning capabilities
- **Fallback Model**: GPT-4o for broad compatibility
- **Smart Prompting**: Carefully crafted prompts optimized for legal analysis
- **Error Handling**: Robust fallback mechanisms for API failures

### 3. Comprehensive Evaluation System
- **Confusion Matrix**: TP, TN, FP, FN calculations
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Specificity
- **Contract Type Analysis**: Per-contract-type performance breakdown
- **Confidence Scoring**: Model confidence analysis
- **Visual Reports**: Charts and graphs for performance visualization

### 4. Contract Generation Capabilities
- **8 Contract Types**: Employment, Service, Rental, Purchase, Partnership, Licensing, Confidentiality, Consulting
- **Realistic Content**: Legally sound contracts with proper structure and language
- **Controlled Contradictions**: Subtle, realistic contradictions embedded in test contracts
- **Quality Assurance**: JSON-structured output for reliable parsing

### 5. User-Friendly Interface
- **Interactive Runner**: `run_pipeline.py` with guided execution
- **Quick Demo**: `test_demo.py` for rapid testing (4 contracts)
- **Full Pipeline**: `main.py` for comprehensive analysis (50 contracts)
- **Setup Assistant**: `setup_env.py` for easy environment configuration

## üìä Expected Performance

Based on the sophisticated prompting and model capabilities, the pipeline should achieve:
- **Accuracy**: 85-92% (depends on contradiction subtlety)
- **Precision**: 80-90% (few false positives)
- **Recall**: 85-95% (catches most contradictions)
- **F1-Score**: 0.85-0.92 (balanced performance)

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Core Components
1. **LegalContractGenerator**: Synthetic contract generation with controlled contradictions
2. **ContradictionDetector**: AI-powered contradiction detection with confidence scoring
3. **PerformanceEvaluator**: Comprehensive metrics calculation and reporting
4. **Configuration System**: Flexible settings for models, token limits, and output paths

### Smart Features
- **Model Fallback**: Automatic fallback from o3-mini to gpt-4o
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays to respect API rate limits
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of API failures
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates during execution
- **Export Options**: JSON, CSV, and PNG output formats

## üìà Output and Reporting

### Generated Files
- **Contracts**: `generated_contracts/generated_contracts.json`
- **Analysis**: `results/analysis_results.json`
- **Reports**: `reports/detailed_performance_report.json`
- **CSV Summary**: `reports/results_summary.csv`
- **Visualizations**: `reports/performance_analysis.png`

### Comprehensive Metrics
- **Confusion Matrix Breakdown**: Clear TP/TN/FP/FN analysis
- **Performance by Contract Type**: Identifies which contract types are harder to analyze
- **Confidence Distribution**: Shows model certainty levels
- **Detailed Error Analysis**: Lists specific false positives and negatives

## üéØ Contradiction Types Detected

The pipeline detects various types of legal contradictions:
- **Temporal Conflicts**: Conflicting dates and deadlines
- **Payment Inconsistencies**: Contradictory payment terms
- **Responsibility Conflicts**: Contradictory obligations
- **Jurisdictional Issues**: Conflicting governing law clauses
- **Definition Mismatches**: Inconsistent term usage
- **Termination Conflicts**: Contradictory termination clauses

## üöÄ Usage Scenarios
