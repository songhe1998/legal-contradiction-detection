        You are an expert legal analyst. I want you to analyze this legal contract for contradictions, but I want to see your COMPLETE reasoning process.

        CONTRACT TO ANALYZE:
        {contract_text}

        ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
        1. Think step-by-step through your analysis
        2. Show your reasoning for each potential issue you identify
        3. Explain why something is or isn't a contradiction
        4. Distinguish between formatting issues vs substantive contradictions

        RESPONSE FORMAT:
        Please provide your analysis in this exact format:

        STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:
        [Show your detailed thought process here - what you're looking for, what you find, why it matters]

        POTENTIAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
        [List each potential issue and your reasoning about whether it's actually a contradiction]

        FINAL DECISION:
        Has contradictions: [true/false]
        Confidence: [0.0-1.0]

        CONTRADICTIONS FOUND:
        [If any, list them with specific reasoning]

        IMPORTANT: 
        - Show your complete reasoning process
        - Explain the difference between cross-reference errors and actual contradictions
        - Consider that legal documents may have formatting flexibility
        - Focus on substantive conflicts that would cause legal problems
