      "contract_text": "CONTRACT OF BUSINESS COLLABORATION\n\nThis Contract of Business Collaboration (\u201cContract\u201d) is made and entered into as of the 1st day of November, 2023 (\u201cEffective Date\u201d), by and between:\n\nParty A: Alpha Solutions Incorporated, a corporation duly organized under the laws of the State of New York, with its principal office located at 123 Business Plaza, New York, NY 10001 (\u201cAlpha\u201d); and\n\nParty B: Beta Enterprises LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware, with its principal office at 456 Commerce Drive, Wilmington, DE 19801 (\u201cBeta\u201d).\n\nCollectively referred to herein as the \u201cParties.\u201d\n\nRECITALS\n\nWHEREAS, Alpha and Beta desire to enter into a collaboration for the purposes of jointly developing and marketing certain innovative technologies (the \u201cProject\u201d); and\n\nWHEREAS, the Parties intend that this Contract shall set forth the terms and conditions governing their respective rights and obligations related to the Project;\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises herein contained, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:\n\n1. SCOPE OF COLLABORATION  \n1.1. Purpose. The Parties shall cooperate in the research, development, marketing, and sale of the Project pursuant to the terms of this Contract.  \n1.2. Exclusivity. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, Alpha grants Beta exclusive rights with respect to the Project in North America; however, Beta reserves the right to engage with other partners for similar projects in the same territory, provided that such engagement does not substantially conflict with Alpha\u2019s strategic interests.\n\n2. TERM AND TERMINATION  \n2.1. Term. This Contract shall commence on the Effective Date and shall remain in full force and effect for a period of five (5) years unless terminated in accordance with the provisions herein.  \n2.2. Early Termination. Either Party may terminate this Contract upon thirty (30) days\u2019 written notice if the other Party breaches any material term herein.  \n2.3. Automatic Renewal. In contrast to Section 2.1, if no Party has notified the other of its intent to terminate this Contract at least sixty (60) days prior to the end of the then-current term, this Contract shall automatically renew for an additional period of two (2) years.  \n2.4. Contradictory Termination Provisions. Notwithstanding any notice or termination right set forth herein, should a dispute arise regarding performance under Section 6 below, this Contract shall continue in effect during mediation, even if a valid termination notice has been provided.\n\n3. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PARTIES  \n3.1. Duties of Alpha. Alpha shall provide all technical expertise, intellectual property, and research personnel necessary for the successful development of the Project.  \n3.2. Duties of Beta. Beta shall oversee marketing, distribution, and related business development activities and shall assume financial responsibility for all expenses incurred post-development.  \n3.3. Joint Obligations. Both Parties shall collaborate in good faith to ensure deadlines and milestones are met. Paradoxically, each Party retains sole discretion over their respective teams and may not be held jointly liable for delays resulting from unilateral decisions.\n\n4. FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS  \n4.1. Payment. Beta agrees to pay Alpha a fee equal to 10% of the net profits derived from the Project.  \n4.2. Budget Allocation. Expenses shall be allocated on a 50/50 basis. However, in circumstances where additional fiscal adjustments are determined necessary by either Party, all costs shall instead be borne entirely by the Party initiating the adjustment.  \n4.3. Revenue Sharing. Notwithstanding Section 4.1, if Beta\u2019s annual revenue exceeds $5 million from the sale of the Project, Alpha shall receive only 5% of net profits, even if such adjustment conflicts with the initial fee structure.\n\n5. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  \n5.1. Ownership. Each Party shall retain sole ownership of its pre-existing intellectual property. All intellectual property developed jointly under this Contract shall be owned jointly by the Parties.  \n5.2. Licensing. Each Party grants to the other a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to utilize its pre-existing intellectual property for the Term of this Contract. Contrarily, any collaboration-derived intellectual property shall be exclusively licensed to Alpha, with Beta receiving a non-transferable, limited license for internal use only.\n\n6. DISPUTE RESOLUTION  \n6.1. Negotiation and Mediation. In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Contract, the Parties agree initially to settle the dispute amicably through negotiation, and if that fails, through mediation administered by an agreed-upon mediator.  \n6.2. Arbitration. Should mediation fail, the dispute shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration conducted in New York pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Notably, notwithstanding the arbitration clause, either Party may opt to pursue litigation if the dispute involves issues that the arbitrator deems not adaptive to arbitration.\n6.3. Contradictory Resolution Mechanism. In any instance where the mediation clause contradicts the specific arbitration requirement presented in Section 6.2, the mediation process shall always supersede the arbitration process for disputes considered \u201cnon-material\u201d even though the arbitration decision shall govern \u201cmaterial\u201d disputes.\n\n7. CONFIDENTIALITY  \n7.1. Definition. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any non-public information disclosed by one Party to the other, whether in written, oral, or electronic form during the Term.  \n7.2. Obligations. The Parties shall not disclose Confidential Information to any third party except as required by law. However, the Parties expressly agree that disclosure to any affiliated company shall not be deemed a breach of confidentiality.\n7.3. Exceptions. Information shall not be deemed Confidential Information if it becomes publicly available through no act or omission of the receiving Party. In an apparent contradiction, even if such information becomes public, the receiving Party shall, upon the disclosing Party\u2019s request, limit further dissemination of related sensitive information on a need-to-know basis.\n\n8. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES  \n8.1. Mutual Representations. Each Party represents and warrants that it has the full power and authority to enter into this Contract.  \n8.2. Accuracy of Information. Both Parties warrant that all information provided in connection with this Contract is true and accurate to the best of their knowledge, notwithstanding that each Party expressly reserves the right to amend any representation without prior notice should discrepancies later arise.\n8.3. Non-Contradiction. Notwithstanding any representation or warranty herein, neither Party shall be held liable for any conflicts or contradictions in the terms of this Contract as long as each Party acted in good faith.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY  \n9.1. Liability Cap. Except in instances of gross negligence or willful misconduct, neither Party shall be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or related to this Contract.  \n9.2. Contradictory Liability Provision. In contrast to Section 9.1, in circumstances where the breach of Section 3 (Responsibilities) or Section 6 (Dispute Resolution) leads to quantifiable losses, each Party agrees that the maximum liability shall be unlimited, notwithstanding the foregoing limitation.\n\n10. MISCELLANEOUS  \n10.1. Entire Agreement. This Contract constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral.  \n10.2. Amendments. Any modifications or amendments to this Contract must be in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. However, if any Party deems an amendment necessary, said amendment shall immediately become effective upon notification, provided that such amendment is subsequently ratified by the other Party within thirty (30) days.  \n10.3. Governing Law. This Contract shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, notwithstanding any conflicting jurisdictional requirements stated elsewhere in this Contract.  \n10.4. Severability. If any provision of this Contract is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any contradictory clause remains, the invalidity of one clause shall automatically validate the contradictory clause.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have executed this Contract as of the Effective Date.\n\n____________________________________  \nAuthorized Signature  \nAlpha Solutions Incorporated  \nName: _________________________  \nTitle: __________________________\n\n____________________________________  \nAuthorized Signature  \nBeta Enterprises LLC  \nName: _________________________  \nTitle: __________________________\n\n[End of Contract]\n\nNote: This document is intended as a sample contract containing intentional contradictory clauses for illustrative purposes.

Provider and Client are hereinafter jointly referred to as the \u201cParties\u201d and individually as a \u201cParty.\u201d\n\nWHEREAS, Provider is engaged in the business of offering specialized consulting and technology integration services (the \u201cServices\u201d); and  \nWHEREAS, Client desires to obtain the Services from Provider subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement;  \n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:\n\n1. DEFINITIONS  \n   1.1 \u201cServices\u201d means the consulting, technical support, and technology integration services as more particularly described in Appendix A attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.  \n   1.2 \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any non-public information provided by one Party to the other, whether in written, oral, digital, or other form, and agrees to be held in confidence as set forth in Section 8 herein.\n\n2. TERM AND TERMINATION  \n   2.1 Term.  \n       (a) This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall remain in full force and effect for an initial term of one (1) year (\u201cInitial Term\u201d).  \n       (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agreement shall terminate automatically after six (6) months unless renewed in writing by both Parties at least thirty (30) days prior to such expiration date.\n   2.2 Termination.  \n       (a) Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days\u2019 written notice if the other Party materially breaches any provision hereof.  \n       (b) Notwithstanding (a), if Provider fails to deliver the Services within thirty (30) days following notice of delay, Client may immediately terminate this Agreement without further liability.  \n       (c) Contradictorily, termination for convenience may be done only after a minimum term of twelve (12) months despite the initial term of one (1) year described in Section 2.1(a).\n\n3. SERVICES AND PERFORMANCE  \n   3.1 Scope of Services.  \n       Provider agrees to perform the Services as described in Appendix A. However, the Services shall be performed in a timely manner while also taking no less than sixty (60) days to complete such services.  \n   3.2 Performance Standards.  \n       (a) Provider represents and warrants that all Services shall be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner in accordance with industry standards.  \n       (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Provider shall hold Client harmless for any delays when industry conditions mandate a minimum waiting period of no less than ninety (90) days.  \n   3.3 Modification of Services.  \n       Any modification to the scope of the Services must be agreed to in writing by both Parties; however, Provider reserves the unilateral right to modify the Services schedule on a day-to-day basis without Client consent.\n\n4. COMPENSATION  \n   4.1 Fees and Payment.  \n       (a) Client shall pay Provider a fee of $100,000 for the Services rendered during the term of this Agreement. An advance payment of 50% of the fee shall be due upon execution, with the remaining balance to be paid upon completion.  \n       (b) Notwithstanding Clause 4.1(a), Provider acknowledges that payment in full is only due upon completion of Services that may extend beyond the term of this Agreement.  \n       (c) Any late payment shall incur interest at a rate of 1.5% per month; however, if payments are rendered in arrears exceeding 60 days, the interest rate shall automatically be reduced to 0.5% per month.\n   4.2 Expenses.  \n       Client agrees to reimburse Provider for reasonable and pre-approved out-of-pocket expenses. Still, Provider shall bear all costs if the total reimbursable expenses exceed $10,000 during any given month.\n\n5. CONFIDENTIALITY  \n   5.1 Obligation of Confidentiality.  \n       Each Party agrees to maintain the confidentiality of Confidential Information and not to disclose such information to third parties except as expressly permitted under this Agreement.  \n   5.2 Permitted Disclosures and Exceptions.  \n       Notwithstanding Section 5.1, if required by law or court order, the disclosing Party may reveal the Confidential Information without prior notice to the other Party. Additionally, the Parties agree that all Confidential Information may be shared with public domain materials released by the Parties, regardless of the restrictions set forth herein.\n\n6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  \n   6.1 Ownership.  \n       All pre-existing intellectual property owned by either Party prior to the execution of this Agreement shall remain the sole property of that Party.  \n   6.2 Work Product.  \n       The Parties agree that any intellectual property developed solely by Provider in connection with the Services shall be deemed \u201cwork made for hire\u201d and shall automatically be assigned to Client. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Provider retains a perpetual, non-exclusive license to use all work product for reference and portfolio purposes.\n\n7. INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY  \n   7.1 Indemnification.  \n       Each Party shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other from any and all claims, liabilities, damages, or losses arising directly or indirectly from the performance of this Agreement.  \n   7.2 Limitation of Liability.  \n       In no event shall either Party be liable to the other for any indirect, consequential, or incidental damages. However, Provider\u2019s liability shall be unlimited in the event of any failure to perform Services timely, even if such event occurs in accordance with Section 3.2(b).\n   7.3 Contradictory Remedy.  \n       Notwithstanding Sections 7.1 and 7.2, Provider shall be solely responsible for any and all risk or liability if it is determined that both Parties have acted in tandem, even if such determination contradicts the indemnification provisions set forth in Section 7.1.\n\n8. MISCELLANEOUS  \n   8.1 Governing Law.  \n       This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles that would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.  \n   8.2 Notices.  \n       Any notices required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and deemed effectively given when delivered by hand or sent by certified mail or email to the last known address of the Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, notices are only considered delivered when receipt is confirmed in writing.\n   8.3 Amendments.  \n       This Agreement may not be amended, modified, or supplemented except by a written instrument executed by both Parties. However, Provider reserves the right to modify any term of this Agreement unilaterally by issuing a notice to Client, with such modifications becoming effective immediately upon receipt by Client.\n   8.4 Entire Agreement.  \n       This Agreement, including all exhibits and appendices hereto, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior understandings, representations, or agreements, whether oral or written. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any prior oral agreement that expressly contradicts any written provision of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.\n   8.5 Severability.  \n       If any term or provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. Notwithstanding this, if any single provision is deemed wholly unenforceable, the Agreement shall automatically terminate.\n   8.6 Counterparts.  \n       This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.\n   8.7 Force Majeure.  \n       Neither Party shall be liable for any delay or failure in the performance of any part of this Agreement to the extent such delay or failure is caused by events or circumstances beyond its reasonable control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Provider agrees that any force majeure event lasting longer than thirty (30) days shall automatically result in the immediate termination of this Agreement, which is in conflict with Section 2.2(b) as noted above.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the Effective Date.\n\nFOR ALPHA SOLUTIONS INC.
