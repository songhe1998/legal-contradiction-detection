      "Conflicting Dates: Section 2.1 states that the term of the Agreement commences on June 15, 2024 (the 'Commencement Date'), but the preamble and signature block state the Agreement is made and effective as of June 1, 2024 (the 'Effective Date'). This creates ambiguity as to when employment actually begins.",
      "Inconsistent Payment Schedule: Section 3.1 states that salary is payable 'no less frequently than monthly,' but Section 3.7 states that salary is paid bi-weekly. This creates confusion as to the actual payroll schedule.",
      "Contradictory Governing Law and Jurisdiction: Section 8.1 states that the Agreement is governed by Delaware law, but Section 8.2 requires disputes to be resolved exclusively in courts located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This creates a conflict between the governing law and the forum for dispute resolution.",
      "Mismatched Definition vs Usage: In Section 5.1, the non-competition obligation is limited to the United States, but Section 1.2 requires the Employee to devote 'full business time and attention' to the Company and not engage in any other business without consent, with no geographic limitation. This creates ambiguity regarding the scope of permissible outside activities, especially if the Employee were to engage in non-competitive business outside the United States."

Additional Services\\n\\nAny services requested by Client that are outside the scope of Exhibit A shall be billed at Provider’s standard hourly rate of $200 per hour, subject to prior written approval by Client.\\n\\n3. Expenses\\n\\nClient shall reimburse Provider for all reasonable travel and lodging expenses incurred in connection with the Services, provided such expenses are pre-approved in writing by Client.\\n\\n4. Payment Terms\\n\\nProvider shall submit invoices upon completion of each milestone. Payment is due within thirty (30) days of the date of invoice.\\n\",\n  \"contradictions\": [\n    \"Conflicting Payment Terms: Section 4.3 states that Client shall pay all undisputed amounts within thirty (30) days of the date of invoice, while Section 4.5 states that all payments for Services shall be due within forty-five (45) days of the date of invoice. Exhibit B, Section 4, also states payment is due within thirty (30) days. This creates confusion as to whether payment is due in 30 or 45 days.\",\n    \"Conflicting Governing Law and Jurisdiction: Section 14.1 states the Agreement is governed by the laws of Delaware, but Section 14.2 requires that any legal action be brought exclusively in the courts located in San Francisco County, California. This creates a conflict between the governing law and the jurisdiction for disputes.\",\n    \"Contradictory Intellectual Property Ownership: Section 5.1 states that all Deliverables and intellectual property rights therein shall be owned by Provider, except as otherwise provided in Section 5.2. Section 5.2 states that to the extent any Deliverables constitute a 'work made for hire,' such Deliverables shall be deemed to be owned by Client, and Provider assigns all rights to Client. This creates ambiguity as to who owns the Deliverables, especially since software development work often qualifies as a work made for hire.\",\n    \"Mismatched Definition and Usage of 'Services': Section 1.1 defines 'Services' as those described in Exhibit A, but Section 2.4 (Effect of Termination) requires Provider to deliver 'all completed Deliverables and all work in progress,' and Client to pay for 'all Services performed and expenses incurred up to the effective date of termination.' However, Exhibit B, Section 1, states that payment is only upon completion of milestones, not for partial or in-progress work, creating a conflict regarding payment for partially completed",

      "Conflicting Rent Amounts: Section 3.1 states the monthly rent is $1,400.00, but Section 3.5 states that the rent is $1,500.00 for the first six months, then $1,400.00 thereafter. This creates ambiguity about the actual rent due for the first six months.",
      "Contradictory Utility Responsibilities: Section 6.1 states Tenant is responsible for all utilities, including water and sewer, but Section 6.2 states Landlord is responsible for water and sewer charges. This creates a conflict regarding who pays for water and sewer.",
      "Contradictory Repair Obligations: Section 7.2 states Landlord is responsible for repairs to structural components (roof, foundation, exterior walls), except if caused by Tenant’s negligence, but Section 7.4 states Tenant is responsible for all repairs to the roof, foundation, and exterior walls regardless of cause. This creates a direct conflict over who is responsible for major repairs.",
      "Conflicting Governing Law Clauses: Section 15.1 states the Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Franklin, but Section 15.2 states that any dispute is governed by the laws of the State of Columbia. This creates a substantive legal contradiction regarding jurisdiction."
