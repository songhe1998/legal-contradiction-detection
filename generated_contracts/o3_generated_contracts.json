The indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume control of the defense and settlement of such claim, provided that it does not settle any claim without the prior written consent of the indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────\n10. DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n10.1 Negotiation. In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, or validity thereof (a “Dispute”), the Parties shall first attempt to resolve the Dispute by good faith negotiations.\n\n10.2 Mediation. If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute within fifteen (15) Business Days following the commencement of negotiations, the Parties shall participate in mediation conducted by a mediator mutually agreed upon by the Parties, held in New York, New York. The mediation process shall be conducted in accordance with rules agreed upon in writing by the Parties.\n\n10.3 Arbitration. Should the Dispute not be resolved by mediation within thirty (30) Business Days, the Dispute shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall be conducted in New York, New York, and all arbitration proceedings shall be held in the English language. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\n\n10.4 Costs. Each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses in connection with any negotiation, mediation, or arbitration, except that the arbitrator may, in its award, allocate the fees, costs, and expenses (including legal fees) between the Parties as it deems equitable.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────\n11. TERMINATION\n────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n11.1 Termination for Cause. Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other Party if:\n  a. The other Party commits a material breach of any term or condition of this Agreement and such breach is not cured within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of written notice specifying the breach (see Section 12.2);\n  b. A Force Majeure Event (see Section 12.4) continues for a period of more than thirty (30) consecutive days and substantially impairs the ability of the affected Party to perform its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n11.2 Termination Without Cause. Buyer may terminate this Agreement without cause by providing Seller with no less than thirty (30) Business Days’ written notice to that effect. In such event, Buyer shall reimburse Seller for any costs reasonably incurred in connection with the preparation or performance of this Agreement, including any non-cancellable obligations undertaken prior to such termination, but shall not be obligated to pay any further amounts under this Agreement.\n\n11.3 Effects of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement, all rights and obligations of the Parties shall cease, except:\n  a. The obligations under Sections 3, 7, 9, 10, 11.3, 12, 13, and 14, which shall survive termination and remain in full force and effect;\n  b. Any amounts that",

    "text": "{\n  \"contract\": \"CONSULTING AGREEMENT\\n\\nThis Consulting Agreement (the \\\"Agreement\\\") is entered into as of February 1, 2023 (the \\\"Effective Date\\\") by and between Global Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at 123 Corporate Way, Wilmington, DE (\\\"CLIENT\\\"), and Apex Consulting Partners, LLC, a limited liability company organized and existing under the laws of the State of New York with its principal place of business at 456 Enterprise Drive, New York, NY (\\\"CONSULTANT\\\"). CLIENT and CONSULTANT are hereafter referred to collectively as the \\\"Parties\\\" and individually as a \\\"Party,\\\" for purposes of this Agreement.\\n\\nRECITALS\\nA. CLIENT desires to engage CONSULTANT to provide specialized management and business strategy consulting services (the \\\"Services\\\") pursuant to the terms herein.\\nB. CONSULTANT possesses expertise in strategic business development, project management, and financial analysis, and CLIENT desires to leverage such expertise.\\nC. The Parties desire to set forth the terms and conditions under which the Services will be provided.\\n\\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained and other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency and receipt of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:\\n\\n1. DEFINITIONS\\n   1.1. \\\"Confidential Information\\\" means all non-public information disclosed by either Party, whether written, oral or recorded in any form, including but not limited to business strategies, financial data, trade secrets, recipes, client lists, or other proprietary information. For the avoidance of doubt, Confidential Information does not include information that (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement; (ii) was rightfully in the possession of the receiving Party prior to disclosure by the disclosing Party; or (iii) is received by the receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a third party.\\n   1.2. \\\"Deliverables\\\" refers to the documents, software, reports, analyses, and other tangible results prepared by CONSULTANT pursuant to the scope of work described herein.\\n   1.3. \\\"Project Milestones\\\" are the pre-agreed phases and deadlines for the completion of key portions of the Services as specified in Exhibit A attached hereto.\\n   1.4. \\\"Intellectual Property\\\" means any inventions, discoveries, improvements, developments, trade secrets, and any other work product, including copyrightable or patentable materials, resulting from or related in any way to the performance of the Services.\\n   1.5. \\\"Term\\\" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 3.\\n\\n2. SCOPE OF SERVICES\\n   2.1. CONSULTANT Responsibilities: CONSULTANT shall provide CLIENT with advice and assistance in strategic planning, market analysis, and financial management. This shall include reviewing internal protocols, conducting on-site evaluations, furnishing recommendations for cost efficiencies, and, where deemed beneficial, providing training modules for CLIENT personnel.\\n   2.2. CLIENT Responsibilities: CLIENT agrees to provide CONSULTANT access to necessary company records, relevant personnel, and facilities as reasonably required to carry out the Services. CLIENT shall also designate a project liaison to coordinate the timely exchange of information.\\n   2.3. Additional Tasks: Notwithstanding the general description above, CONSULTANT shall also endeavor to integrate strategic advice into daily operational practices and, subject to further agreement in writing, may also assist in client-facing negotiations. Such integration, however, shall in no event conflict with the independent consultancy role assigned to CONSULTANT as set forth herein.\\n   2.4. Adjustments: The Parties agree that any modifications to the scope of Services must be made in writing and amended in an addendum to this Agreement signed by both Parties.\\n\\n3. TERM AND TERMINATION\\n   3.1. Initial Term: The Agreement shall be in effect from February 1, 2023 (Effective Date) until January 31, 2024 (the \\\"Initial Term\\\").\\n   3.2. Extension: Upon written mutual agreement, the term may be extended for additional periods not exceeding one year each. In a separate section (see Section 6.3 on Payment Schedules), the performance period for certain milestones is defined to continue beyond February 1, 2024 and up to February 1, 2025.\\n   3.3. Termination for Convenience: Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon providing thirty (30) days written notice to the other Party. Notwithstanding, termination for convenience pursuant to Section 3.3 shall not affect deadlines for Work already commenced as set forth in Exhibit A.\\n   3.4. Termination for Cause: Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately if the other Party breaches any material term, and such breach is not cured within fifteen (15) days after written notice is provided. In the event of termination for cause, CLIENT shall pay CONSULTANT for all Services adequately performed through the effective date of termination.\\n   3.5. Conflicting Deadline Note: While Section 3.1 sets the contract’s duration ending on January 31, 2024, Section 6.3 and the Project Milestones in Exhibit A reference key deliverable deadlines extending to February 1, 2025. This is intended to reflect differing operational timelines but may require further management interpretation if contractual performance extends into the extended milestone period.\\n\\n4. PAYMENT TERMS\\n   4.1. Consulting Fee: CLIENT shall pay CONSULTANT a fee based on two different models:\\n       (a) Hourly Rate: An hourly rate of $150 for all consulting services rendered on a time-and-material basis; and\\n       (b) Fixed Fee: A lump-sum fee of $200,000 for the completion of the agreed Project Milestones in Exhibit A.\\n       The Parties acknowledge that these models are intended to cover different aspects of the Services, with the hourly rate applying primarily to advisory meetings and additional research, and the fixed fee covering strategic deliverable development. However, Consultant shall not bill concurrently for both models on the same work products.\\n   4.2. Payment Schedule: Payments under the Hourly Rate model shall be invoiced monthly, payable within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice. Payments under the Fixed Fee arrangement shall be made in installments according to the Project Milestone achievement schedule set forth in Exhibit A.\\n   4.3. Late Payment and Penalties: If any payment is not received within thirty (30) days, CLIENT shall incur a penalty fee of 1.5% per month on the outstanding balance. However, Section 6.3 sets a different interpretation of payment due dates with some installments explicitly defined as payable upon milestone acceptance, which may lead to ambiguity in calculating late penalties.\\n   4.4. Reimbursable Expenses: CLIENT shall reimburse CONSULTANT for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with providing the Services, provided such expenses have been pre-approved in writing by CLIENT.\\n   4.5. Contradictory Remuneration Terms: The dual payment structure (hourly versus fixed fee) is designed to provide flexibility; however, the separate installment framework in Section 6.3 for milestone achievements may lead to confusion regarding which fee structure applies to overlapping services provided within the same time period.\\n\\n5. PROJECT MILESTONES AND REPORTING\\n   5.1. Milestone Schedule: Detailed Project Milestones, including deliverable deadlines, performance criteria, and quality benchmarks, are detailed in Exhibit A attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.\\n   5.2. Deliverable Acceptance: CLIENT shall have seven (7) days from receipt of any Deliverable to provide written acceptance or a list of discrepancies, upon which CONSULTANT shall have fifteen (15) days to correct such discrepancies to achieve final acceptance.\\n   5.3. Reporting: CONSULTANT shall submit progress reports on a bi-weekly basis, which shall include a summary of work performed, upcoming milestone targets, and any issues impacting performance. In the event of conflicting deadlines between this reporting cycle and the deadlines included in Exhibit A (particularly when milestones extend beyond the Initial Term), the milestone schedule shall take precedence for deliverable acceptance.\\n\\n6. MILESTONE-BASED PAYMENT SCHEDULE\\n   6.1. Payment on Milestone Completion: For the Fixed Fee arrangement, payments shall be triggered upon CLIENT’s written acceptance of each milestone as detailed in Exhibit A.\\n   6.2. Payment Adjustments: Should a milestone not be met as per the agreed timeline, CLIENT reserves the right to deduct 5% of the milestone fee per week of delay, up to a maximum of 20%. However, Section 4.3’s monthly invoicing mechanism may conflict with these deductions for overlap periods.\\n   6.3. Extended Performance Period: For certain advanced deliverables, the performance period extends to February 1, 2025, which stands in contrast with the overall Agreement Term specified in Section 3.1. This extension is provided to cover long-term strategic planning requirements, though it may expose the Parties to uncertainty regarding the termination of the Agreement.\\n\\n7. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\\n   7.1. Ownership of Deliverables: All right, title, and interest in and to the Deliverables, including the Intellectual Property contained therein, shall be vested in CLIENT, subject to an irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual license to CONSULTANT for non-commercial internal purposes only.\\n   7.2. Pre-Existing Materials: CONSULTANT shall retain ownership of any pre-existing intellectual property. However, CLIENT shall receive an exclusive license to use such pre-existing materials, which is limited solely to the term of this Agreement.\\n   7.3. Consultant’s Work Products: Notwithstanding Section 7.1, CONSULTANT retains all rights to methodologies and proprietary learning or techniques that are used in connection with the performance of the Services. The Parties acknowledge that this creates a potential contradiction regarding the ownership of work performed collaboratively versus pre-existing intellectual property.\\n   7.4. Contradictory IP Clauses: The above clauses are intended to provide CLIENT with a broad license to use all deliverables while preserving CONSULTANT’s pre-existing rights; however, the language in Section 7.1, when juxtaposed with Section 7.3, may give rise to disputes over the extent of intellectual property rights for jointly-developed content.\\n\\n8. CONFIDENTIALITY\\n   8.1. Obligation: Each Party agrees to hold Confidential Information in strict confidence and not disclose it to third parties except as required by law or with the other Party’s written consent.\\n   8.2. Duration of Confidentiality: CLIENT and CONSULTANT agree that confidentiality obligations under this Agreement shall survive for a period of five (5) years following the termination or expiration of this Agreement.\\n   8.3. Exception: Notwithstanding the foregoing, Section 9.4 (Return of Materials) below provides that all confidentiality obligations shall expire one (1) year after termination, unless otherwise required by statute or mutually agreed in writing, thereby creating potential ambiguity regarding the post-termination confidentiality period.\\n   8.4. Permitted Disclosures: If disclosure is required by law, the disclosing Party shall provide prompt written notice to the other Party in order to allow the other Party to seek a protective order or other remedy.\\n\\n9. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES\\n   9.1. CONSULTANT Representations: CONSULTANT represents and warrants that:\\n       (a) It has the necessary expertise, experience, and licenses to provide the Services;\\n       (b) The performance of the Services does not conflict with any other obligations or contractual commitments;\\n       (c) All Services will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner, conforming to generally accepted industry standards; and\\n       (d) It shall abide by all applicable laws and regulations.\\n   9.2. CLIENT Representations: CLIENT represents and warrants that:\\n       (a) It possesses the authority to enter into this Agreement;\\n       (b) It shall provide all necessary information and resources to enable CONSULTANT to perform the Services; and\\n       (c) It shall operate in compliance with all relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.\\n   9.3. No Implied Warranties: Except as expressly provided herein, neither Party makes any warranties, express or implied, regarding any matter.\\n   9.4. Return of Materials: Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, each Party shall return or destroy the other Party’s Confidential Information. However, due to the contradictory language in Section 8.3 regarding the duration of confidentiality, the moment and manner of such return may be subject to interpretation.\\n\\n10. INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\\n   10.1. Mutual Indemnification: Each Party agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other Party, including its officers, directors, employees, and agents, from any and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of any breach of this Agreement or any negligent or intentional act of such Party.\\n   10.2. Limitation of Liability: In no event shall either Party be liable to the other for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special, or punitive damages, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.\\n   10.3. Liability Cap: CONSULTANT’s total aggregate liability under this Agreement arising from any claim shall not exceed the total fees paid by CLIENT to CONSULTANT under this Agreement. However, Section 4.3’s penalty mechanisms might in certain circumstances effectively exceed this cap, thereby introducing a potential conflict.\\n   10.4. Exclusions: Nothing in this Section shall serve to limit or exclude liability for death or personal injury resulting from negligence, or for any breach of confidentiality obligations herein.\\n\\n11. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION\\n   11.1. Governing Law: This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflicts of law principles.\\n   11.2. Dispute Resolution: The Parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute arising under or in connection with this Agreement by negotiation. In the event that a dispute cannot be so resolved, the dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association.\\n   11.3. Arbitration Venue: Notwithstanding Section 11.1, any arbitration proceedings regarding disputes under this Agreement shall be held in New York City, New York. This contradictory provision between the Governing Law (Section 11.1) and the Arbitration Venue (Section 11.3) may give rise to jurisdictional ambiguity.\\n   11.4. Choice of Forum: CLIENT and CONSULTANT expressly agree that any court action arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction in New York, despite the prevailing Governing Law as set forth in Section 11.1. The Parties agree that while the",

Licensor and Licensee are sometimes individually referred to herein as a “Party” and collectively as the “Parties.”\\n\\nRECITALS\\nWHEREAS, Licensor is the owner and/or authorized licensee of certain proprietary technology, software, trademarks, and other intellectual property as described in Exhibit A attached hereto (the “Intellectual Property”);\\n\\nWHEREAS, Licensee desires to obtain from Licensor an exclusive license to use, modify, and distribute the Intellectual Property solely for Licensee’s internal business operations and for further commercialization in accordance with the terms set forth herein;\\n\\nWHEREAS, Licensor is willing to grant to Licensee such rights, and Licensee is willing to accept and perform its obligations under the terms and conditions of this Agreement;\\n\\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and representations, warranties, and undertakings herein contained, and other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:\\n\\n1. DEFINITIONS\\n1.1. \\\"Confidential Information\\\" means any non-public, proprietary, or confidential information for which a reasonable person would understand is proprietary to a Party, including all business, technical, and financial information. Confidential Information includes but is not limited to trade secrets, customer lists, and any documentation or information provided under this Agreement. Notwithstanding, the term may at times refer to obligations described in Section 8 which differ in duration.\\n\\n1.2. \\\"Effective Date\\\" means the date as stated above. However, in Section II, the term of this Agreement references a commencing date of January 1, 2023, creating potential divergence from subsequent date references.\\n\\n1.3. \\\"Licensed Materials\\\" shall comprise the Intellectual Property, related documentation, updates, modifications, and enhancements provided under this Agreement. In certain sections, referential usage may imply more restrictive rights, thereby rendering inconsistency with the broader definition here.\\n\\n1.4. \\\"Territory\\\" shall mean worldwide, except as otherwise specified in Section 5 where license-related commercialization efforts might be limited to specific jurisdictions.\\n\\n1.5. \\\"Sublicense\\\" means any right by which Licensee, through a writing approved in advance by Licensor, may grant the Licensed Materials to third parties subject to the conditions herein.\\n\\n2. GRANT OF LICENSE\\n2.1. License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee an exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (except as provided herein) license to use, modify, and distribute the Licensed Materials in the Territory solely for the development, testing, and commercialization of Licensee’s products.\\n\\n2.2. Scope of Use. Licensee shall have the right to incorporate the Licensed Materials into its own products or services, provided that the use of the Licensed Materials is clearly identified in product documentation.\\n\\n2.3. Quality Assurance. Licensee agrees to maintain high standards of quality and security in connection with the use of the Licensed Materials. Licensor retains the right to review and audit Licensee’s usage of the Licensed Materials to ensure compliance with the terms herein.\\n\\n3. OBLIGATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES\\n3.1. Licensor Responsibilities. Licensor shall provide the most current version of the Licensed Materials along with supporting documentation. Additionally, Licensor will maintain its records of intellectual property registration, update the Patent Status as necessary, and provide technical support for critical issues affecting the operation of the Licensed Materials. Notably, Section 6 contradicts this by allocating similar maintenance responsibilities to Licensee in certain scenarios.\\n\\n3.2. Licensee Responsibilities. Licensee agrees to use the Licensed Materials only in conformity with applicable laws and in accordance with the instructions provided by Licensor. Licensee is obligated to maintain detailed records of its use, distribute updates to designated users, and notify Licensor promptly of any inaccuracies or anomalies in the Licensed Materials.\\n\\n3.3. Joint Obligations. The Parties agree to cooperate in good faith to resolve challenges that arise in connection with the Licensed Materials. Each Party shall bear its own costs unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing. However, inconsistencies exist in subsequent sections regarding allocation of support responsibilities and financial liabilities.\\n\\n4. TERM, RENEWAL, AND TERMINATION\\n4.1. Term. This Agreement shall commence on January 1, 2023 and shall continue in full force and effect until December 31, 2025 (the “Term”), unless terminated earlier pursuant to this Section 4. In Section 7, however, an alternate termination date of December 31, 2024 is referenced for certain obligations, creating a conflict regarding the overall contract duration.\\n\\n4.2. Renewal. The Agreement may be renewed upon mutual written consent at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the Term. Renewal shall be subject to renegotiation of payment terms and other material elements of this Agreement.\\n\\n4.3. Termination for Convenience. Either Party may terminate this Agreement for any reason upon providing ninety (90) days’ written notice to the other Party. Should such termination occur, the Licensee shall immediately cease all use of the Licensed Materials.\\n\\n4.4. Termination for Breach. Any material breach by either Party shall permit the non-breaching Party to terminate this Agreement upon providing a thirty (30) days’ written notice of the breach to the breaching Party. If the breach is cured within such period, termination shall not occur. However, Section 11 imposes additional conditions on termination that may extend or abbreviate these notice periods, potentially leading to legal ambiguities regarding termination conditions.\\n\\n4.5. Effect of Termination. Upon termination, Licensee shall cease all use of the Licensed Materials, and within thirty (30) days shall provide Licensor with a full accounting of all sales and copies of the Licensed Materials. Licensor agrees to support Licensee for a transitional period of thirty (30) days post-termination, except as otherwise provided in Section 11, which suggests a different transition period.\\n\\n5. PAYMENT TERMS AND LICENSE FEES\\n5.1. Payment Obligations. In consideration for the rights granted under this Agreement, Licensee shall pay Licensor a license fee. The initial fee shall be an amount of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) payable within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date. Notwithstanding, Section 5.4 below sets forth installment payments that conflict with this one-time fee structure.\\n\\n5.2. Payment Method. All payments shall be made by wire transfer to a bank account designated by Licensor. Failure to tender payment in accordance with this provision shall be considered a material breach of this Agreement.\\n\\n5.3. Late Payment Penalties. Any late payments shall incur interest at a rate of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower. The imposition of such penalties shall not relieve Licensee of any other financial obligations under this Agreement.\\n\\n5.4. Installment Payments. In a separate schedule outlined in Section 9, Licensee agrees to pay license fees in equal quarterly installments of Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000) over the initial two-year period from the Effective Date, subject to performance benchmarks. Both provisions are intended to coexist, but they present inconsistent payment structures resulting in ambiguity regarding total payment amounts and schedules.\\n\\n6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND MAINTENANCE\\n6.1. Ownership. Licensor exclusively retains title, ownership, and all intellectual property rights in and to the Licensed Materials, including all modifications, enhancements, and derivative works. Notwithstanding, certain amendments later in this Agreement, particularly in Section 12, indicate that Licensee may own certain derivative works, leading to inconsistencies regarding intellectual property ownership.\\n\\n6.2. Updates and Maintenance. Licensor agrees to provide updates and patches for the Licensed Materials at no additional cost during the Term. However, the responsibility to maintain and update relevant intellectual property registration records is uniquely allocated to Licensee in Section 3.1, creating a potential conflict in responsibilities.\\n\\n6.3. Sublicensing Restrictions. Licensee shall not have the authority to sublicense the Licensed Materials without obtaining a written, prior consent from Licensor, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. These requirements shall be interpreted in alignment with any obligations imposed later in this Agreement regarding third-party arrangements.\\n\\n7. MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS AND SUPPORT SERVICES\\n7.1. Record Keeping. Licensee shall maintain accurate records of its use of the Licensed Materials and shall make such records available to Licensor upon reasonable request. The record keeping obligation as detailed here is consistent with Section 3.2 but appears to conflict with overlapping requirements in Section 10 relating to audit rights.\\n\\n7.2. Technical Support. Licensor agrees to provide technical support to Licensee via email and phone during normal business hours. However, a conflicting provision in Section 13 states that major technical support will be provided exclusively by Licensee for all intellectual property-related matters, thereby creating confusion about the source and extent of support services.\\n\\n8. CONFIDENTIALITY\\n8.1. Confidentiality Obligations. Each Party agrees to maintain in strict confidence all Confidential Information received from the other Party and to use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of performing its obligations under this Agreement.\\n\\n8.2. Duration of Confidentiality. Except as required by law, the obligations under this Section shall survive termination of this Agreement for a period of five (5) years from the date of such termination. Contrariwise, Section 14 provides a different survival period for confidentiality obligations.\\n\\n8.3. Exceptions. The obligations set forth in this Section shall not apply to any portion of the Confidential Information that (a) is or becomes generally available to the public without breach of this Agreement, (b) is rightfully received by the receiving Party from a third party without restriction, or (c) is independently developed by the receiving Party without access to or knowledge of the Confidential Information.\\n\\n9. PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS AND QUALITY ASSURANCE\\n9.1. Milestone Payment Schedule. Licensee agrees to adhere to performance benchmarks as set forth in Exhibit B. Payments made under Section 5.4 are contingent upon Licensee achieving specific benchmarks as detailed therein. Failure to achieve such benchmarks shall trigger a review of the installment amounts and potentially result in adjustments as determined by a joint committee.\\n\\n9.2. Quality Assurance Reviews. The Parties shall, on an annual basis, conduct quality assurance reviews to assess the performance and compatibility of the Licensed Materials with Licensee’s products. The results of such reviews shall be documented in writing and reviewed by both Parties.\\n\\n10. AUDIT RIGHTS AND COMPLIANCE\\n10.1. Audit. Licensor shall have, upon giving at least thirty (30) days written notice, the right to audit Licensee’s records and systems to ensure compliance with the terms of this Agreement. The audit rights provided herein are in addition to any other rights reserved by Licensor in any other section that refers to record keeping.\\n\\n10.2. Remediation. If an audit uncovers material non-compliance by Licensee, Licensee shall promptly correct such deficiencies within thirty (30) days upon receiving written notice from Licensor. The process for remediation hereby may conflict with certain accelerated timelines provided in Section 7.2 for technical support responses.\\n\\n11. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES\\n11.1. Mutual Representations. Each Party represents and warrants that (a) it has full power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement, (b) the execution and performance of this Agreement does not violate any agreement or obligation to which it is bound, and (c) there is no pending or threatened litigation that could adversely affect its ability to perform its obligations hereunder.\\n\\n11.2. Licensor Warranties. Licensor warrants that it is the owner or duly licensed to grant the rights conveyed herein. Licensor further warrants that the Licensed Materials will conform in all material respects to the specifications set forth in Exhibit A. Notwithstanding, Section 12 introduces additional warranties that may limit or qualify the warranties presented herein, thereby inducing potential interpretative conflicts.\\n\\n11.3. Disclaimer. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION, THE LICENSED MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED \\\"AS IS\\\", WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\\n\\n12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION\\n12.1. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. The aggregate liability of either Party under this Agreement shall in no event exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct. Certain sections, however, contain language implying a higher cap under alternate circumstances.\\n\\n12.2. Indemnification by Licensee. Licensee agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Licensor from and against all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to Licensee’s use of the Licensed Materials, except to the extent caused by Licensor’s negligence. Some subsequent clauses in Section 12 further adjust these indemnification terms in cases of combined liability, creating an ambiguity as to which standard applies.\\n\\n12.3. Indemnification by Licensor. Licensor shall indemnify and hold Licensee harmless from claims arising directly from Licensor’s breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding, a conflict arises in subsequent sections referring to limits on liability that could potentially reduce Licensor’s indemnification responsibilities.\\n\\n13. TECHNICAL SUPPORT TRANSITION\\n13.1. Transition Provisions. In the event of termination due to breach or otherwise, Licensor will provide transitional technical support for a period of thirty (30) days. However, in Section 7.2, technical support provided by Licensor is scheduled to cease immediately upon termination, which creates an inherent contradiction regarding the post-termination support window.\\n\\n13.2. Data Migration. Licensee shall be responsible for any costs associated with the migration of data or transition of systems post-termination, except where such migration is necessitated by a Licensor error.\\n\\n14. SURVIVAL OF OBLIGATIONS\\n14.1. Survival. Notwithstanding termination of this Agreement, the following obligations shall survive: Sections 8 (Confidentiality), 10 (Audit Rights), 11 (Representations and Warranties), and 12 (Limitation of Liability and Indemnification). The confidentiality obligations under Section 8 are herein extended to remain in effect for a period of ten (10) years after termination, which conflicts with the five (5) year period stated in Section 8.2.\\n\\n14.2. Transitioning Activities. The Parties shall continue to cooperate in respect to any transitioning activities, including the orderly return or destruction of Confidential Information, for a period up to six (6) months following termination. This clause supplements Section 4.5 and may create inconsistencies regarding responsibilities post-termination.\\n\\n15. MISCELLANEOUS\\n15.1. Notice. All notices or communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given when delivered personally or sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the addresses set forth above or such other address as either Party may designate by notice to the other.\\n\\n15.2.

    "text": "PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT\n\nThis PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT (the “Agreement”) is made and entered into as of April 1, 2023 (the “Effective Date”), by and between Alpha Ventures LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of New York with its principal place of business at 123 Wall Street, New York, NY 10005 (hereinafter referred to as \"Partner A\"), and Beta Innovations Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, with its principal office located at 456 Market Street, Wilmington, DE 19801 (hereinafter referred to as \"Partner B\"). Partner A and Partner B shall hereinafter be collectively referred to as the “Partners” or individually as a “Partner.”\n\nRECITALS\n\nWHEREAS, the Partners desire to establish a business partnership for the purpose of developing, marketing, distributing, and selling innovative technological solutions (the \"Business\"); and\n\nWHEREAS, the Parties wish to define their respective rights, duties, obligations, and liabilities with respect to the Business as provided herein;\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Partners agree as follows:\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n   1.1. \"Business\" means the joint operations as defined in this Agreement, including but not limited to operation, manufacture, marketing, and sale of technological products and services. \n   1.2. \"Confidential Information\" means all non-public information disclosed by one Party to the other, regardless of format, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential under the circumstances. \n   1.3. \"Effective Date\" means the date set forth in the preamble above. \n   1.4. \"Intellectual Property\" means patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other proprietary rights, whether registered or unregistered.\n   1.5. \"Net Profits\" means the gross revenue received minus any agreed operating, administrative, and other ordinary business expenses as explicitly provided herein.\n\n2. SCOPE OF THE BUSINESS\n\n   2.1. Purpose. The primary objective of the partnership is to collaborate in the research, development, commercialization, and distribution of advanced technological solutions, specifically in the sectors of digital innovation, green energy technology, and software development.\n   2.2. Exclusivity. Both Partners agree that during the term of this Agreement, neither may undertake any endeavor that competes directly with the Business without prior written consent from the other Partner.\n   2.3. Territorial Scope. The Business activities covered under this Agreement shall be conducted worldwide, subject to any local regulatory requirements.\n\n3. PARTNERSHIP CAPITAL AND CONTRIBUTIONS\n\n   3.1. Initial Capital. The Partners agree to contribute capital in the following proportions:\n       (a) Partner A shall contribute $500,000 USD in cash and in-kind resources (technical equipment and proprietary software licenses).\n       (b) Partner B shall contribute $750,000 USD in cash as well as human resources, market research data, and distribution networks.\n   3.2. Additional Contributions. Additional funding may be provided on a need basis, subject to mutual written agreement, and will not alter the respective percentage ownership unless otherwise specified in subsequent amendments.\n   3.3. Ownership Interests. Each Partner’s initial ownership interest shall be determined by their respective contributions, with Partner A holding approximately 40% and Partner B approximately 60% of the equity rights in the Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain sections of this Agreement may refer to ownership on an equal basis for decision-making purposes.\n\n4. MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE\n\n   4.1. Management Committee. A Management Committee composed of two designated representatives from each Partner shall oversee the day-to-day operations, strategic planning, and major financial decisions regarding the Business.\n   4.2. Voting. Decisions by the Management Committee require a majority vote. For decisions affecting the core operational strategy, a unanimous vote is required. In instances where the vote is tied, the matter shall be deferred to mediation as described in Section 9. \n   4.3. Duties and Responsibilities. \n       a. Partner A shall manage research and development, product innovation, and the procurement of technological tools.\n       b. Partner B shall oversee marketing, sales, distribution, and overall customer relations. \n       c. Both Parties will collaborate on product launch strategies, intellectual property development, and investor relations. However, further in the document, there is an expectation that Partner A share overall strategic decision-making duties equally with Partner B, which may conflict with the above provisions.\n\n5. FINANCIAL MATTERS\n\n   5.1. Revenue Sharing. Net Profits of the Business shall be distributed monthly based on the following schedule:\n       (a) Partner A shall receive 35% of the Net Profits; \n       (b) Partner B shall receive 65% of the Net Profits.\n   5.2. Payment Terms. \n       a. All payments disbursed to the Partners shall be calculated quarterly and distributed within ten (10) days of the close of the quarter.\n       b. In Section 5.3, it is however stated that all profit distributions shall occur on a monthly basis, with payments processed within fifteen (15) days after month-end, thereby potentially causing ambiguity regarding frequency and timing of payments.\n   5.3. Expense Reimbursements. Partners shall be reimbursed for direct expenses incurred in relation to Business operations upon presentation of detailed receipts. Reimbursement shall be carried out within thirty (30) days from the receipt of valid supporting documentation.\n   5.4. Audit Rights. Either Partner may request an independent audit of the Business’s financial records once per fiscal year. The audit costs shall be borne equally by both Partners, unless significant discrepancies arise wherein the non-defaulting Partner may demand reimbursement for audit fees.\n\n6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\n   6.1. Ownership of Pre-Existing Intellectual Property. Each Partner shall retain sole ownership of any Intellectual Property that was developed or acquired prior to the Effective Date. \n   6.2. Jointly Developed Intellectual Property. Intellectual Property developed jointly during the term of this Agreement shall be jointly owned by the Partners. Notably, however, Section 8.5 later purports that all Intellectual Property arising from collaboration shall be solely owned by Partner B, except where explicitly stated otherwise in a separate addendum. This divergence creates a potential conflict regarding intellectual property ownership rights.\n   6.3. Licensing Rights. Both Partners grant each other a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the joint Intellectual Property in connection with the Business operations for the duration of this Agreement.\n   6.4. Protection and Enforcement. Each Partner is responsible for enforcing and defending their own Intellectual Property rights. In cases of infringement, the Partners shall collaborate to take appropriate legal action.\n\n7. CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE\n\n   7.1. Confidential Information Handling. Both Partners agree to maintain strict confidentiality of all Confidential Information obtained in the course of the partnership. \n   7.2. Duration of Confidentiality. The confidentiality obligations shall survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of five (5) years following the termination date.\n   7.3. Exceptions. Information that is publicly available, was independently developed without breach of this Agreement, or is required to be disclosed by law, shall not be subject to these confidentiality restrictions. In Section 10.2, however, it is suggested that the confidentiality obligations extend indefinitely for certain highly sensitive materials, thereby introducing a subtle inconsistency concerning the duration of confidentiality obligations.\n\n8. TERM AND TERMINATION\n\n   8.1. Term. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and, unless earlier terminated as set forth herein, continue for an initial term of five (5) years.\n   8.2. Renewal. Upon expiry of the initial term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either Partner provides written notice of intent not to renew at least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the then-current term.\n   8.3. Termination for Cause. Either Partner may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the other if there is a material breach of any provision herein which is not cured within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice thereof.\n   8.4. Termination Without Cause. Either Partner may elect to terminate this Agreement without cause subject to the following conditions:\n       (a) Termination must be provided with a notice period of no less than thirty (30) days; however, Section 11.1 later mandates a sixty (60) day notice period under certain conditions, resulting in an internal contradiction regarding the required notice period. \n       (b) All outstanding financial obligations must be settled within ninety (90) days from the effective date of termination.\n   8.5. Post-Termination Rights. Upon termination, each Partner shall have a non-transferable, revocable license to use the Business-related Intellectual Property and Confidential Information solely for the purpose of winding down ongoing operations. As stated in Section 6.2, disputes may arise concerning exclusive ownership of Intellectual Property developed during the partnership and thus the actual rights post-termination may become ambiguous.\n\n9. DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n   9.1. Negotiation. In the event of any dispute arising between the Partners in connection with or relating to this Agreement, the Parties shall first attempt to resolve such dispute amicably through good faith negotiations.\n   9.2. Mediation. Should negotiations fail to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days, the dispute shall be submitted to mediation under the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The mediation shall be held in New York unless mutually agreed otherwise.\n   9.3. Arbitration. If the dispute is not resolved by mediation within sixty (60) days, the same dispute shall then be finally resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Notably, Section 9.4 below dictates a different mechanism for dispute resolution for contract breaches related to confidentiality claims, which may result in differing forms of resolution being available.\n   9.4. Confidential Dispute Resolution. In disputes solely regarding breaches of confidentiality obligations, the Partners agree to resolve such issues exclusively through litigation in the courts of Delaware. This provision may conflict with the arbitration procedure outlined in Sections 9.2 and 9.3.\n\n10. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES\n\n   10.1. Mutual Representations. Each Partner represents and warrants that it has the full capacity, power, and authority to enter into this Agreement and fully perform its obligations hereunder; that entering into this Agreement does not violate any other agreement or law; and that any Information or data provided to the other Partner is accurate and complete.\n   10.2. Non-Infringement. Each Partner warrants that the performance of their obligations will not infringe upon or misappropriate any Intellectual Property right of any third party.\n   10.3. Authority. The individuals executing this Agreement on behalf of each Partner are duly authorized to bind their respective organizations. Any documents or communications referencing their authority shall be given full faith and credit in all proceedings.\n\n11. MISCELLANEOUS\n\n   11.1. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Section 9.4 dictates that disputes concerning confidentiality shall be litigated in Delaware, creating a jurisdictional ambiguity which must be resolved by the courts.\n   11.2. Amendments. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written document executed by both Partners. The amendment process shall require unanimous consent from the Management Committee.\n   11.3. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with any exhibits, schedules, and addenda attached hereto, represents the entire understanding between the Partners regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior negotiations, understandings, or agreements between the Partners, whether written or oral.\n   11.4. Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.\n   11.5. Notices. All notices or communications required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered personally, or transmitted via email, facsimile, or certified mail (return receipt requested) to the addresses set forth above or to such other address as may be designated by notice.\n   11.6. Force Majeure. Neither Partner shall be liable for any delay or failure in performance of any obligation under this Agreement due to causes beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, war, terrorism, government regulations, or market disruptions.\n   11.7. Waiver. No waiver of any breach of any term or condition hereof shall be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other term or condition, whether similar or dissimilar.\n   11.8. Assignment. Neither Partner shall assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, except that either Partner may assign this Agreement to a successor entity in connection with a merger or sale of substantially all of its assets.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have executed this Partnership Agreement on the day and year first above written.\n\nFOR ALPHA VENTURES LLC:\n_________________________________________\nName: Jonathan Michaels\nTitle: Managing Director\nDate: April 1, 2023\n\nFOR BETA INNOVATIONS INC.:\n_________________________________________\nName: Samantha Lee\nTitle: Chief Executive Officer\nDate: March 15, 2023\n\nAPPENDIX A: ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nA.1. Special Covenants. The Partners agree that any additional obligations will be negotiated in good faith in future addenda. Nothing in this Appendix shall override the provisions of Sections 6.2 and 11.1.\n\nA.2. Insurance and Indemnity. Each Partner shall maintain adequate insurance coverage for risks arising out of their respective contributions to the Business. Indemnification limits as detailed under the financial terms are subject to a cap of $1,000,000 for direct claims; however, under certain circumstances described later in addendum attachments, the cap may increase to $2,000,000, thus leading to potential uncertainty in indemnification obligations.\n\nA.3. Dispute Escalation. Prior to initiating any of the dispute resolution procedures in Section 9, the Management Committee shall meet at least once every quarter for a formal review session to raise and resolve any emerging concerns. The minutes of such meetings shall be maintained and referenced in future dispute resolutions.\n\nA.4. Confidentiality of Negotiations. All discussions regarding potential amendments or addenda to this Agreement shall be treated as Confidential Information, subject to the confidentiality obligations established in Section 7. However, as noted earlier in Section 7.3, the duration of such obligation may inconsistently extend indefinitely for select categories of information.\n\nA.5. Miscellaneous Provisions. The Partners acknowledge that this Agreement is a complex instrument intended to capture the breadth of their collaborative intentions. In the event that any internal inconsistencies arise, the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to ameliorate the effect of such contradictions, though such negotiations shall not be deemed a waiver of any rights under this Agreement.\n\n[End of Agreement]",

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not include any information that (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Receiving Party; (ii) was within the possession of the Receiving Party prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party; (iii) is obtained by the Receiving Party without a breach of this Agreement from a third party with lawful access; or (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information.\\n\\n1.2 \\\"Term\\\" means the duration of this Agreement as provided in Section 3 below.\\n\\n1.3 \\\"Effective Date\\\" means the date on which this Agreement is signed by the last Party executing it, as set forth in Section 18.\\n\\nSECTION 2 – PURPOSE\\n\\n2.1 The Parties agree that the Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement shall be used solely for the Permitted Purpose.\\n\\nSECTION 3 – TERM AND TERMINATION\\n\\n3.1 This Agreement shall commence as of the Effective Date and remain in effect for a period of five (5) years (the “Term”).

Termination of this Agreement shall not relieve either Party of its confidentiality obligations hereunder as set forth in Section 10.\\n\\n3.3 Early termination shall not affect any accrued rights or obligations, except that any payments, fees, or penalties due prior to termination shall survive in accordance with the terms of Sections 6 and 7.\\n\\nSECTION 4 – SCOPE OF DISCLOSURE\\n\\n4.1 The Disclosing Party shall disclose Confidential Information only to those of its employees, consultants, and agents who are bound by similar confidentiality obligations and only to the extent necessary to accomplish the Permitted Purpose.\\n\\n4.2 The Receiving Party agrees to restrict disclosure of Confidential Information within its organization to its directors, officers, employees, and approved consultants having a need to know and shall not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party without obtaining the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\\n\\nSECTION 5 – OBLIGATIONS OF THE RECEIVING PARTY\\n\\n5.1 The Receiving Party agrees:\\n    (a) To maintain the Confidential Information in strict confidence and to exercise at least the same degree of care in safeguarding the Confidential Information as it does with its own confidential information, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care;\\n    (b) Not to disclose or disseminate the Confidential Information to any third party except as permitted in this Agreement;\\n    (c) To use the Confidential Information solely for the Permitted Purpose;\\n    (d) To make no copies of the Confidential Information unless required by the nature of the Permitted Purpose; and\\n    (e) To notify the Disclosing Party immediately upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information.\\n\\n5.2 The Receiving Party’s responsibility for safeguarding Confidential Information is subject to any instructions provided by the Disclosing Party. However, in Section 11 below, the Receiving Party is similarly required to contribute to documenting and preserving proprietary rights, creating an ambiguity regarding central responsibility in the event of a data breach.\\n\\nSECTION 6 – PAYMENT TERMS\\n\\n6.1 In consideration of the disclosure of Confidential Information, the Receiving Party agrees to pay the Disclosing Party a fee of USD 1,000 per month. This payment is due on the first calendar day of each month commencing on the Effective Date.\\n\\n6.2 Late payments shall incur a penalty of 2% per month on the outstanding balance.\\n\\n6.3 Payment adjustments or revisions shall be made only in writing and executed by both Parties. This section shall survive termination of this Agreement with regards to any outstanding payment obligations.\\n\\nSECTION 7 – FEES, EXPENSES, AND OTHER FINANCIAL TERMS\\n\\n7.1 Notwithstanding Section 6, for certain projects outlined in Attachment A of this Agreement, the Receiving Party agrees to a modified fee schedule of USD 1,200 per month. In such cases, any delays beyond a grace period of fifteen (15) days shall incur additional penalties calculated at a rate of 3% per month on the outstanding balance.\\n\\n7.2 The Parties agree that any additional out-of-pocket costs incurred as a direct result of the performance under this Agreement shall be reimbursed by the Receiving Party upon presentation of valid documentation.\\n\\n7.3 In the event of a dispute regarding any fees or expenses, the Parties agree to resolve such dispute by engaging in mediation as described in Section 16.\\n\\nSECTION 8 – CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS\\n\\n8.1 The Receiving Party agrees that the Confidential Information shall remain confidential for a period of three (3) years from the termination of this Agreement.

This includes, but is not limited to, password-protected systems, secure storage facilities, and access logs.\\n\\n12.2 The Receiving Party shall, upon request, provide the Disclosing Party with written confirmation of its compliance with the data security measures outlined in this Section.\\n\\n12.3 Notwithstanding the obligations herein, conflicting responsibilities emerge between Section 5.1 and Section 11 regarding maintenance and documentation of secure storage, leading to ambiguity over which Party bears the ultimate responsibility in instances of data compromise.\\n\\nSECTION 13 – REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES\\n\\n13.1 Each Party represents and warrants that it has the legal right and authority to enter into this Agreement and that the performance of its obligations hereunder does not violate any applicable law or regulation or any agreement to which it is a party.\\n\\n13.2 The Disclosing Party makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information, and the Receiving Party agrees that the Disclosing Party shall have no liability to the Receiving Party resulting from the use of the Confidential Information.\\n\\n13.3 The Receiving Party further represents and warrants that all individuals having access to the Confidential Information on its behalf have been informed of and agree (in writing when possible) to confidentiality obligations at least as protective as those contained herein.\\n\\nSECTION 14 – GOVERNING LAW\\n\\n14.1 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of law rules.\\n\\n14.2 In the event of any dispute arising under or in connection with this Agreement, such dispute shall, as a first resort, be resolved via mediation pursuant to Section 16.\\n\\nSECTION 15 – ASSIGNMENT\\n\\n15.1 Neither Party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, except in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all of its assets.\\n\\n15.2 Any purported assignment in violation of this Section shall be null and void.\\n\\nSECTION 16 – DISPUTE RESOLUTION\\n\\n16.1 In the event of a dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Parties agree to first try to resolve the dispute through informal negotiation.\\n\\n16.2 If the dispute has not been resolved within thirty (30) days of the commencement of negotiations, the Parties agree to submit the dispute to mediation in the State of California under the then-current rules of mediation promulgated by a recognized mediation body. This mediation clause conflicts with the governing law provision in Section 14, which calls for New York law, thereby creating a potential jurisdictional ambiguity.\\n\\n16.3 Should mediation fail to resolve the dispute, the Parties shall submit to arbitration in accordance with the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding.\\n\\nSECTION 17 – NOTICES\\n\\n17.1 All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers, and other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given: (i) when delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt); (ii) when received by the addressee if sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier (with written confirmation of receipt); or (iii) on the date sent by email or facsimile if sent during normal business hours on a business day, or on the next business day if sent after normal business hours.\\n\\n17.2 Notices shall be addressed to the parties as follows (or to such other address as a party may designate by notice to the other Party in accordance with this Section):\\n\\nFor the Disclosing Party:\\nGlobal Tech Disclosures, Inc.\\n123 Innovation Way\\nWilmington, DE 19801\\nEmail: legal@globaltechdisclosures.com\\n\\nFor the Receiving Party:\\nBright Ideas Solutions, LLC\\n789 Enterprise Plaza\\nDover, DE 19901\\nEmail: contracts@brightideassolutions.com\\n\\nSECTION 18 – MISCELLANEOUS\\n\\n18.1 This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the Parties regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior agreements, understandings, or representations, whether oral or written.\\n\\n18.2 In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.\\n\\n18.3 This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.\\n\\n18.4 The Parties acknowledge that certain definitions provided in Section 1 (such as the definition of Confidential Information excluding publicly available data) are not entirely consistent with the usage in subsequent sections (e.g., Section 8 which appears to include such data under certain circumstances), thereby introducing a latent ambiguity in the interpretation of what constitutes Confidential Information.\\n\\n18.5 The Parties agree that any dispute not resolved through the procedures stated herein shall be resolved in a manner that is mutually agreeable, and that both Parties will negotiate in good faith to achieve a resolution.\\n\\n18.6 This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.\\n\\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF,",
