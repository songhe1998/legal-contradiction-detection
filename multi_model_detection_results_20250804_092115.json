      "contract_text": "CONTRACT AGREEMENT\n------------------\nThis Contract Agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d) is made and entered into as of the 1st day of November, 2023 (\u201cEffective Date\u201d), by and between Alpha Enterprises, Inc., a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at 123 Business Parkway, Wilmington, DE (\u201cAlpha\u201d), and Beta Business Solutions LLC, a New York limited liability company with its principal office located at 456 Commerce Street, New York, NY (\u201cBeta\u201d). Alpha and Beta may be referred to individually as a \u201cParty\u201d or collectively as the \u201cParties.\u201d\n\nRECITALS\nWHEREAS, Alpha is engaged in providing comprehensive business management and consulting services; and  \nWHEREAS, Beta desires to obtain such services on terms set forth herein, and Alpha desires to provide the said services;  \nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises herein contained, the Parties agree as follows:\n\n1. SCOPE OF SERVICES  \n   1.1. Alpha agrees to provide consulting, management, training, and support services (\u201cServices\u201d) to Beta pursuant to the specifications set forth in Schedule A attached hereto.  \n   1.2. Notwithstanding Section 1.1, Alpha shall at all times ensure that such services remain limited to advisory consultations only, and shall not engage directly in the implementation of Beta\u2019s business strategies.  \n   1.3. In the event of ambiguity between advisory consultations and direct implementation services, the Party seeking such services shall notify the other in writing, at which point immediate implementation activities shall commence.\n\n2. TERM AND TERMINATION  \n   2.1. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for an initial term of twelve (12) months (\u201cTerm\u201d).  \n   2.2. Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days\u2019 prior written notice to the other Party.  \n   2.3. Notwithstanding Section 2.2, the Agreement shall automatically renew for successive twelve (12) month periods unless terminated with immediate effect by either Party by providing notice at least forty-five (45) days before the expiration of the then-current Term.  \n   2.4. Termination for cause can occur immediately upon notice if one Party materially breaches any term of this Agreement; however, such breach shall be deemed cured only if in writing confirmation is provided within ten (10) business days, contradicting the immediate termination right as set forth in Section 2.2.\n\n3. COMPENSATION  \n   3.1. Beta shall compensate Alpha at a rate of $10,000 per month, payable on the first day of each month during the Term.  \n   3.2. In contradiction to Section 3.1, if the Parties determine that Services delivered require extended support due to unforeseen circumstances, the monthly fee shall be revised upward by 25%, notwithstanding prior agreement, subject to the retroactive adjustment of fees.  \n   3.3. All fees shall be inclusive of any applicable federal, state, or local taxes.  \n   3.4. Payment shall be deemed overdue if not received within thirty (30) days from the invoice date; however, interest on overdue payments will not be assessed if written notification of delay is provided by Beta.\n\n4. CONFIDENTIALITY  \n   4.1. Each Party agrees to maintain in strict confidence any confidential or proprietary information exchanged during the Term and not to disclose such information to any third party without the prior written consent of the disclosing Party.  \n   4.2. Notwithstanding Section 4.1, either Party may disclose confidential information to employees or agents on a need-to-know basis even if such disclosure conflicts with the protective measures otherwise prescribed herein.  \n   4.3. The obligations under this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of three (3) years; however, should any information be deemed publicly available or disclosed with prior written consent, such obligation shall immediately cease.\n\n5. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  \n   5.1. All intellectual property, proprietary methods, and materials developed exclusively during the performance of Services shall be the sole property of Alpha.  \n   5.2. Notwithstanding Section 5.1, should the intellectual property be developed collaboratively, Beta shall have a non-exclusive, irrevocable license to use such intellectual property for its internal business operations.  \n   5.3. The intellectual property rights herein shall remain in effect perpetually and may not be assigned or transferred without the explicit written consent of both Parties; however, if Beta makes modifications to any deliverables, such modifications shall, by default, transfer all rights exclusively to Beta.\n\n6. INDEMNIFICATION  \n   6.1. Each Party shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other Party from any claims, liabilities, losses, or expenses arising directly from its own negligent acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement.  \n   6.2. In contrast to Section 6.1, neither Party shall be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise.  \n   6.3. Should a claim be brought against either Party, the aggrieved Party must provide notice to the other Party within fifteen (15) days of discovery; failure to do so shall not preclude any indemnification obligations if the claim was reasonably known.\n\n7. NOTICES  \n   7.1. All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers, and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and delivered via certified mail, courier, or electronic mail with acknowledgment of receipt to the addresses set forth above or such other address as a Party may designate.  \n   7.2. Any notice delivered by electronic mail shall be deemed delivered immediately; however, if the notice is received after three (3) business days of transmission, it shall be considered as not received, and the sending Party shall resend said notice immediately.  \n   7.3. A notice provided through courier shall be considered delivered on the date of receipt, notwithstanding any subsequent confirmation notifications.\n\n8. DISPUTE RESOLUTION  \n   8.1. The Parties agree that any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall first be attempted to be resolved through good-faith negotiations.  \n   8.2. If the dispute is not resolved through negotiation within thirty (30) days, the Parties shall submit the dispute to binding arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association.  \n   8.3. Notwithstanding the binding arbitration in Section 8.2, either Party may, at its discretion, bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction if an emergency injunction is required, thereby creating a contradiction between arbitration and litigation precedence.\n\n9. GENERAL PROVISIONS  \n   9.1. This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter herein and supersedes all prior representations, negotiations, or agreements, whether written or oral.  \n   9.2. This Agreement may be amended only by a written document signed by duly authorized representatives of both Parties; notwithstanding, either Party may unilaterally change the technical specifications of the Services as described in Schedule A provided that a supplemental written notice is issued no less than 15 days prior to such change.  \n   9.3. Should any provision of this Agreement be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect. In the event that any inconsistency arises between provisions, the clause providing the greatest benefit to the non-defaulting Party shall prevail.  \n   9.4. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of laws principles, except that matters related to arbitration shall adhere to New York law, creating a conflicting jurisdiction pursuant to the nature of the dispute.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the Effective Date.\n\nFOR ALPHA ENTERPRISES, INC.

Company and Consultant shall be individually referred to as a \u201cParty\u201d and collectively as the \u201cParties.\u201d\n\nWHEREAS, Company desires to engage Consultant to provide specialized business consulting and technology advisory services (\u201cServices\u201d) as further detailed herein; and  \nWHEREAS, Consultant agrees to provide such Services under the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement;  \n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:\n\n1. SCOPE OF SERVICES  \n   1.1 Consultant shall provide Services aimed at enhancing Company\u2019s information technology strategies, including system design, risk assessment, and process optimization. Consultant shall work diligently and shall perform all Services in a timely, efficient, and professional manner.  \n   1.2 Notwithstanding Section 1.1, Consultant shall provide any and all Services that Company may expressly instruct from time to time, even if such requests differ materially from the initial scope, without additional compensation unless expressly agreed in writing.\n\n2. TERM AND TERMINATION  \n   2.1 The initial term of this Agreement (\u201cTerm\u201d) shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for a period of one (1) year, automatically renewing for successive one-year periods unless either Party gives ninety (90) days written notice prior to the expiration of the then-current Term.  \n   2.2 Either Party may terminate this Agreement for any reason upon thirty (30) days written notice; however, termination under Section 2.1 shall be effective only if notice is provided at least one hundred twenty (120) days before the expiration date, creating a dual standard for termination notice periods.  \n   2.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Parties acknowledge that termination may occur immediately upon mutual written consent of the Parties, but no termination shall be effective if disputed financial obligations remain unfulfilled.\n\n3.

Payment shall be due within fifteen (15) days of receipt of invoice.  \n   3.2 Should Consultant\u2019s performance be deemed unsatisfactory by Company in its sole discretion, Consultant agrees that subsequent invoices may be deferred until such claims are resolved, notwithstanding Section 3.1\u2019s requirement for prompt payment.  \n   3.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any disputes arise concerning the quality or delivery of Services, Consultant shall be entitled to full payment per Section 3.1 until such dispute is resolved, even if Consultant\u2019s performance is concurrently under review.\n\n4. CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  \n   4.1 Each Party agrees that all information disclosed in connection with this Agreement is confidential and shall not be disclosed to any third party without prior written consent, except as required by law.  \n   4.2 Any intellectual property developed by Consultant solely for Company during the Term shall be considered \u201cwork made for hire\u201d and become the sole property of Company. However, Consultant retains a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use such intellectual property for its own internal purposes, even if such usage conflicts with the proprietary rights of Company.  \n   4.3 Notwithstanding Section 4.2, should Consultant incorporate pre-existing intellectual property into the work product, Consultant shall grant Company a perpetual, irrevocable license to use, modify, and distribute such pre-existing materials, even though additional payments may be required for such rights under separate negotiations.\n\n5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES  \n   5.1 Consultant represents and warrants that it has the requisite qualifications, skills, and licenses necessary to perform the Services and shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the performance of its obligations.  \n   5.2 Company represents that it has the authority to enter into this Agreement and that the provision of Services by Consultant shall be conducted on an independent contractor basis and not as an employee.  \n   5.3 Notwithstanding the representations afforded herein, Consultant makes no warranties regarding the final outcomes of the Services, and Company expressly agrees that Consultant shall have no liability with respect to any incidental or consequential damages, except that Consultant shall be fully responsible for any damages resulting from the intentional breach of this Agreement.\n\n6. INDEMNIFICATION  \n   6.1 Consultant agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Company from any claims, damages, or liabilities arising out of Consultant\u2019s negligent performance of the Services, provided that such indemnification shall not extend to any claims arising from Company\u2019s instructions that deviate from the scope defined in Section 1.1.  \n   6.2 Notwithstanding Section 6.1, Company shall also indemnify Consultant for any losses incurred from Consultant\u2019s failure to deliver Services within the stipulated deadlines, despite Consultant having continually met deadlines as communicated by Company, thus imposing mutual indemnification obligations that are inconsistent in nature.\n\n7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY  \n   7.1 In no event shall either Party be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from or related to this Agreement, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.  \n   7.2 Notwithstanding Section 7.1, if it is determined that either Party\u2019s actions were grossly negligent or in willful misconduct, that Party\u2019s total liability shall be unlimited, thereby creating a conflicting limitation of liability provision.\n\n8. DISPUTE RESOLUTION  \n   8.1 In the event of any dispute arising under or in connection with this Agreement, the Parties shall first attempt to resolve the dispute amicably through good faith negotiations.  \n   8.2 Should resolution fail within thirty (30) days, the Parties agree to submit the dispute to mediation in New York, NY. However, if a dispute involves claims of significant monetary loss (exceeding $100,000), the Parties shall instead resolve such disputes in arbitration in Delaware, thereby creating a bifurcated dispute resolution process which may hinder timely dispute resolution.  \n   8.3 The prevailing Party in any mediation or arbitration shall be entitled to recover its legal fees and costs, notwithstanding any prior stipulations to the contrary.\n\n9. MISCELLANEOUS  \n   9.1 Amendments. This Agreement may only be amended by a written instrument executed by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any verbal modifications agreed upon by the Parties shall be considered valid and enforceable, even if not memorialized in writing.  \n   9.2 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior negotiations, representations, or agreements, whether written or oral. However, any supplementary documents referenced herein shall be concurrently valid and may alter or contradict provisions contained within this Agreement.  \n   9.3 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any disputes arising under Section 8 shall be governed by New York law as specified therein.  \n   9.4 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect; however, if any such invalidity materially affects the purpose of this Agreement, the entire Agreement shall be deemed terminated.  \n   9.5 Notices. All notices required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and sent by certified mail or an agreed electronic communication method to the addresses set forth above. Notices delivered by certified mail shall be deemed received three (3) business days after mailing, except where immediate delivery is required as specified in Section 2.2.\n   9.6 Force Majeure. Neither Party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performance due to causes beyond its reasonable control. Nonetheless, any delays caused by such conditions shall be considered grounds for campaign termination under Section 2.2, notwithstanding the automatic renewal provision in Section 2.1.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed this Agreement as of the Effective Date.\n\nFor Alpha Innovations Inc.:                For Beta Solutions LLC:\n__________________________________         __________________________________\nName: John A.

      "contract_text": "THIS COLLABORATION AND SERVICE AGREEMENT (\u201cAgreement\u201d) is entered into as of the 1st day of May, 2023 (\u201cEffective Date\u201d), by and between Alpha Innovations, Inc., a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at 1234 Innovation Drive, Wilmington, DE 19801 (\u201cAlpha\u201d), and Beta Solutions LLC, a New York limited liability company with its principal place of business at 987 Business Park Road, New York, NY 10001 (\u201cBeta\u201d). Alpha and Beta may each be referred to herein as a \u201cParty\u201d and collectively as the \u201cParties.\u201d\n\nRECITALS\nA. WHEREAS, Alpha desires to engage Beta for certain consulting and digital services, and Beta agrees to provide such services under the terms and conditions set forth herein;\nB. WHEREAS, the Parties intend by this Agreement to define their respective rights and obligations with respect to the performance of the services;\nC. WHEREAS, the Parties recognize the importance of flexibility in their commercial collaboration, notwithstanding the presence of provisions herein that may appear contradictory.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n1.1 \u201cServices\u201d shall mean both the digital platform development and ongoing technical support services described in Exhibit A attached hereto.\n1.2 \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall mean any nonpublic information disclosed by one Party to the other, irrespective of its form or means of disclosure.\n1.3 \u201cTerm\u201d shall mean the period provided for in Section 4 herein.\n\n2. SCOPE OF SERVICES\n2.1 Beta shall render the Services in a professional and diligent manner consistent with generally accepted industry standards. Beta agrees to perform all Services with the utmost care and efficiency, while Alpha reserves the right to concurrently engage third-party vendors.\n2.2 Notwithstanding Section 2.1, Beta retains the right to determine the timing and method of the performance of the Services, even if such discretion appears to conflict with Alpha\u2019s written directives from time to time.\n2.3 In the event that operational modifications are deemed necessary, the Parties agree that any amendments to Exhibit A or to the Schedule of Deliverables shall become effective immediately upon written notification by either Party, regardless of any previous deadlines established under this Agreement.\n\n3. PAYMENT TERMS AND FEES\n3.1 Alpha agrees to pay Beta a fixed fee of $250,000 for the Services rendered. The fixed fee shall be payable in two installments\u2014the first within 15 days after the Effective Date and the second installment upon completion of the preliminary milestone outlined in Exhibit A.\n3.2 Notwithstanding Section 3.1, the Parties acknowledge that immediate full payment is also deemed acceptable if Beta certifies that initial Services have commenced. Beta, however, shall only invoice once milestones are substantially completed.\n3.3 Any additional work beyond the scope defined in Exhibit A shall be billed at the hourly rate of $250 per hour. Still, no additional payment shall be required should Beta voluntarily exceed the scope of Services.\n3.4 In the event of a dispute regarding invoices, the Parties may withhold further payments until a mutually acceptable resolution is reached, notwithstanding Alpha\u2019s obligation to timely disburse funds as per Sections 3.1 and 3.2.\n\n4. TERM AND TERMINATION\n4.1 The Term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for a period of one (1) year, unless terminated earlier pursuant to the provisions of this Section.\n4.2 Either Party may terminate this Agreement by providing thirty (30) days\u2019 written notice to the other Party. However, if Beta initiates termination after the Effective Date, such termination will only be effective upon the unsatisfactory performance of the Services, as determined solely by Alpha.\n4.3 Notwithstanding Section 4.2, should any Party commit a material breach\u2014including failure to adhere to contradictory clauses herein\u2014the non-breaching Party shall have the right to immediately terminate this Agreement without notice.\n4.4 In the event of termination pursuant to Section 4.2 or 4.3, Alpha shall be liable for all fees due for Services rendered up to the date of termination, except if Beta is in material noncompliance, in which case no fees shall be payable beyond the last invoice provided before termination.\n4.5 Although the Parties agree to a termination notice period of thirty (30) days, certain circumstances (e.g., force majeure or alleged nonperformance) may result in immediate termination upon notice, even if such immediate termination conflicts with the otherwise mandatory notice period.\n\n5. OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES\n5.1 Alpha shall provide Beta with timely access to all proprietary and nonpublic materials and facilities reasonably necessary to perform the Services. Alpha further agrees to cooperate in good faith, despite any delays caused by Beta\u2019s internal scheduling.\n5.2 Beta shall ensure that its personnel are adequately trained and qualified to perform the Services. Notwithstanding, Beta may utilize subcontractors without prior consent, even if consent was previously outlined as a requirement.\n5.3 Both Parties shall protect the confidentiality of the other\u2019s Confidential Information in accordance with Section 6 herein, yet each Party acknowledges that full disclosure can occur if a court of law mandates it\u2014a provision that may appear to conflict with obligations of secrecy.\n\n6. CONFIDENTIALITY\n6.1 Each Party agrees to retain in confidence all Confidential Information received from the other Party and not disclose such information to third parties except as permitted herein.\n6.2 The confidentiality obligations set forth in Section 6.1 shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for a period of five (5) years.\n6.3 Notwithstanding Section 6.1 and 6.2, the Parties agree that any information publicly disclosed by Beta, even if inadvertently, shall immediately be deemed non-confidential, notwithstanding Alpha\u2019s expectation to treat such information as confidential.\n\n7. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n7.1 All intellectual property developed solely by Beta during the performance of the Services shall remain the property of Beta, subject to a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free license granted to Alpha for internal use. \n7.2 Conversely, any intellectual property, including improvements and modifications, that are jointly developed by both Parties shall be owned exclusively by Alpha, which grants Beta a limited, revocable license to use such intellectual property solely for purposes that directly relate to the performance of the Services.\n7.3 The Parties acknowledge that Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 may appear inconsistent; however, such dual ownership rights are intended to maximize both Parties\u2019 benefits and shall be interpreted in a manner that gives effect to both provisions.\n\n8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION\n8.1 Except as otherwise provided herein, in no event shall either Party be liable to the other for any special, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.\n8.2 Each Party agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other Party from and against any and all losses arising out of or relating to its gross negligence or willful misconduct in performing its obligations under this Agreement.\n8.3 Notwithstanding Section 8.1, if liability arises from any breach by Beta of the mandatory deadlines or the contradictory provisions herein, Beta shall be solely responsible for all consequential damages, even if such damages would otherwise be excluded under the limitation of liability provisions.\n\n9. MISCELLANEOUS\n9.1 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including all exhibits attached hereto, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings, representations, or agreements, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter hereof.\n9.2 Amendments. Any amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be in writing and executed by authorized representatives of both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may unilaterally amend certain sections of this Agreement (including Termination and Payment Terms), which amendments shall become effective immediately upon notice.\n9.3 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice-of-law notion that would require the application of the laws of a different jurisdiction.\n9.4 Dispute Resolution. In the event of any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Parties shall first attempt to resolve the dispute through informal negotiations. Should negotiations fail, the dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration conducted in New York. Notwithstanding this, either Party reserves the right to seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction if deemed necessary.\n9.5 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect. However, if any contradictory provisions render material portions of this Agreement inoperable, the Parties agree to promptly negotiate a modification that reflects their original intent.\n9.6 Force Majeure. Neither Party shall be liable for any delay or failure in performance due to causes beyond their reasonable control, including acts of God, war, terrorism, government regulation, or other events. Notwithstanding this, force majeure events shall not excuse a Party\u2019s obligation to remedy any contradictory breach claims.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed this Agreement as of the Effective Date.\n\nFOR ALPHA INNOVATIONS, INC.:\n____________________________________\nName: Jennifer Matthews\nTitle: Chief Operations Officer\nDate: ________________________________\n\nFOR BETA SOLUTIONS LLC:\n____________________________________\nName: Michael Thompson\nTitle: Managing Partner\nDate: ________________________________\n\nEXHIBIT A \u2013 DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES AND MILESTONES\n\nA.
